# AESEncryptionDecryption

In this repository I have shown encryption and decryption of strings in Android Using Kotlin with easiest way. 
You can easily use this way to encrypt and decrypt data in your projects. 

I have shown in the below mentioned youtube video that how one can easily make a custom lottie view rather than using readymade lottie. ->https://youtu.be/oEJqXtsRCQ0

 Add this Dependency in build.gradle (Module :app) : 
dependecies{
    implementation 'com.airbnb.android:lottie:3.4.0'
}
